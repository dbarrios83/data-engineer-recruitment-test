// Streaming Level 1: Rolling Device Stats
// Write your pseudocode solution here

STREAM process_device_stats:
  // Step 1: Read stream and configure watermark
  //   - What is a watermark?
  //   - How late can events arrive?
  
  
  // Step 2: Deduplicate events using event_id
  
  
  // Step 3: Define sliding window
  //   - Window length: 5 minutes
  //   - Slide interval: 1 minute
  //   - What's the difference between sliding and tumbling windows?
  
  
  // Step 4: Group by device and window, aggregate temperature
  
  
  // Step 5: Write stream to output
  //   - Output mode: update, append, or complete?
  //   - When are results emitted?
  
  
END STREAM

// Discuss:
// - What happens to events that arrive after the watermark?
// - How does state grow over time? When can old state be cleaned up?
// - What's the trade-off between watermark delay and data completeness?
// - How would you handle device failures (no readings for extended period)?
// - What if you needed both 5-minute and 1-hour windows?
// - How would you monitor this streaming job in production?
